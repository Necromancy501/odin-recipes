    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>I know what you're thinking. "Necro, I did too much empanadas dough and now I don't know what to do with it". Worry not young lad, because I have the perfect solution for you: Dobladitas.</p>

    <p>This recipe, forged by the gods almighty and brought to you by Necromancy for this TOP project exclusively, was created through torough experimentation and merging of multiple techniques found across various cuisines.</p>

    <p><em>3-4 servings, 30 mins</em></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p>Please reffer to the <a href="empanadas.html" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Empanadas</a> page to see a full list of ingredients. This is supposed to be a leftovers recipe.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven</strong> at 180Â°C.</li>

        <li><strong>Roll the dough</strong> straight from the fridge into the most rectangle-shaped blob you can.</li>

        <li><strong>Cut the resulting block</strong> in four squares.</li>

        <li><strong>Roll the squares</strong> into a rectangle with 2:1 proportions</li>

        <li>Take one corner of the rectangle, <strong>fold it</strong> into the half of the dough and then fold the remaining dough into the pile. <strong>Repeat</strong> with all the squares.</li>

        <li><strong>Place them</strong> in a previously greased tray (or use a baking sheet)</li>

        <li><strong>Bake for 10-15 minutes</strong> right before they start turning golden.</li>
    </ol>
