    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This is not any recipe for Chilean Empanadas. For starters, Necro has delighted everyone with his Empanadas for the past 15 years. This is a <strong>secret recipe</strong> never seen before.</p>

    <p>This recipe, forged by the gods almighty and brought to you by Necromancy for this TOP project exclusively, was created through torough experimentation and merging of multiple techniques found across various cuisines.</p>

    <p><em>15 servings, 2 hs</em></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Butter (70g)</li>
        <li>Flour (700g)</li>
        <li>Milk (400ml)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Cheese (30 Singles)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Melt the butter</strong> in a mug using the microwave until it's fully liquid.</li>

        <li><strong>Mix the melted butter, flour, Milk and Salt in a bowl.</strong> Mix until the dough doesn't stick to your fingers (use more flour if needed). If the dough feels dry and crumbly, add more milk.</li>

        <li><strong>Let the dough rest</strong> for at least half an hour.</li>

        <li><strong>Fold the dough</strong> in half at least 7 times.</li>

        <li><strong>Roll the dough</strong> into a rectangle and cut into at least 10 equal squares.</li>

        <li><strong>Roll a square</strong> in the kitchen counter until you form a disk. Wrap 1.5 cheese singles into this dough disk. Use water to stick the edges before wrapping. You can use a fork to smash the edges further to prevent the cheese leaking in the frying process.</li>

        <li><strong>Repeat</strong> with all the remaining squares</li>

        <li><strong>Leave the resulting empanadas rest</strong> for at least an hour. You can leave them in the fridge overnight at this point for the next day.</li>

        <li><strong>Store any leftover dough</strong> in the fridge for <a href="dobladitas.html">Dobladitas.</a></li>

        <li><strong>Pour enough oil</strong> in a deep pot to cover the empanadas fully. Cook this oil for 5-7 minutes over high heat. <strong>Carefully fry</strong> the empanadas.</li>
    </ol>
