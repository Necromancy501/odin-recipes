    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Yeah yeah, all these recipes have been a blessing in disguise but... we can't do this everyday all day can we? That's why I'm bringing y'all a modern solution for those lunch cravings. Oven fries!</p>

    <p>This recipe, forged by the gods almighty and brought to you by Necromancy for this TOP project exclusively, was created through torough experimentation and merging of multiple techniques found across various cuisines.</p>

    <p><em>2-3 Servings, 40 mins</em></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>6 Medium Potatoes</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        <li>Cheese singles</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven</strong> at 200Â°C.</li>

        <li><strong>Clean the potatoes</strong> and cut any odd looking sprouts and green patches. Repeat across all the potatoes.</li>

        <li><strong>Cut the potatoes</strong> into circles (thickness of your choice) across the whole spud.</li>

        <li><strong>Lay on a previously oiled tray</strong> (or use a banking sheet) and sprinkle the chips with a dash of oil</li>

        <li><strong>Place</strong> the baking tray in the oven.</li>

        <li><strong>Bake for 20-30 minutes</strong> (times may vary) until golden brown. You may need to check every 15 minutes and flip them to see if they have only cooked on one side.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Take the tray out of the oven</strong> and place some cheese on top of the chips you wanna eat now. Place back in the oven for 5-10 seconds until the cheese has melted.</li>
    </ol>
