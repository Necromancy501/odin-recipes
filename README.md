# odin-recipes
TOP First Project

Welcome to my first TOP project!! In this project I was prompt to build a (very basic) html-only recipes website. Throughout
this project I reinforced the knowledge I've aqcuired throughout the first half of the Foundations module and learnt about
Git workflow, VSCode funcionalities and documents formatting.

For this project I was prompt with certain "iterations" which I used as checkpoints for commits. I did my best to actually
make meaningful commits and remember everything I did but one of the main challenges with this was actually remembering what
I did. This project made me realize I need to practice in my Atomic Commits abilities but also I think that's one
of the things that comes with practice so I'm not really feeling overwhelmed by that. I'm happy I could identify
one of my main weaknessess across.

There is certain concepts I don't really grasp fully like the security measures for hyperlinks, the text tags (I had to browse back
to remember the <>p<> tag) and some other really basic funcionalities. That being said, there is certain concepts like basic structure, workflow
and shortcutting that I have somewhat made my strengths and it shows, even in these early stages.

I had lots of fun doing this project and analyzing my strengths and weaknessess across. Everything comes with it's own perks and
drawbacks. I can't wait to keep working in TOP and build some foundations for myself in my coding journey!
